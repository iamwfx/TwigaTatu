# TwigaTatu Web App 
Created for Crowdsourced City (Spring 2016)

This app is a created to collected information about matatu fares in Nairobi, as fares are determined 
through a bargaining system and is not centrally available information.  We believe that having a tool
that helps riders share fare information allows the potential for fairer prices.

# Stack
The website uses basic bootstrap template with PHP and postgres on the back-end.  

# Functionality 
The app allows users to input fare information such as route, time of collection, and amount. 
This information is collected into the database and visualized using D3 visualizaitons. 

# About
This app was created by Mary Makau, Lily Bui, and Wenfei Xu.
